						<h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
						<p>My interest in IT, is in various sectors, such as cyber security, Web Developing and being an IT consultant, and there will be many more areas which will interest me when, In the progress of my degree. My interest In IT developed as a child, it all started from the time, to which both my parents bought a smartphone for themselves, and I would always as a child play new games and try out all the new features possible. My father is a Mechanical Engineer, so he would always be working on machines, which he would tell me about, and he would also tell me all sorts of things about computers, which led a spark in me to study IT. One of my IT experiences was that, in year 9, when I was a high school student, suddenly, one day my laptop did not turn on, and I did watch some YouTube videos to help me solve the problem, since it was a hardware problem on the motherboard I did need some help, so my dad and myself worked on it to figure what the problem was, and we eventually fixed it. 
						
						I chose RMIT university, because I believe that it has a huge reputation in the sector of Technology and Engineering. I also chose RMIT, because I have had a lot of friends recommend it to me and I also have a few senior friends who also currently attend RMIT university.
						
						I expect to learn also sorts of things during this course, especially the aspects that are related to programming, such as learning different programming languages. Another aspect which I want to learn is the SQL language. Other than just theory, I really value practical knowledge too, I do agree that having high knowledge in the theoretical side, does help a lot, but at the same time if you do not have the practical knowledge to execute the theoretical knowledge, it may not help you. I also am looking really forward to learn new things about the security of a device, and how those specific anti-virus programs are made that protect the data of the device. </p>
