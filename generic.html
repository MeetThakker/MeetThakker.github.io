						<h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
						<p>My interest in IT, is in various sectors, such as cyber security, Web Developing and being an IT consultant, and there will be many more areas which will interest me when, In the progress of my degree. My interest In IT developed as a child, it all started from the time, to which both my parents bought a smartphone for themselves, and I would always as a child play new games and try out all the new features possible. My father is a Mechanical Engineer, so he would always be working on machines, which he would tell me about, and he would also tell me all sorts of things about computers, which led a spark in me to study IT. One of my IT experiences was that, in year 9, when I was a high school student, suddenly, one day my laptop did not turn on, and I did watch some YouTube videos to help me solve the problem, since it was a hardware problem on the motherboard I did need some help, so my dad and myself worked on it to figure what the problem was, and we eventually fixed it. </p>
						<p>I chose RMIT university, because I believe that it has a huge reputation in the sector of Technology and Engineering. I also chose RMIT, because I have had a lot of friends recommend it to me and I also have a few senior friends who also currently attend RMIT university.</p>
						<p>I expect to learn also sorts of things during this course, especially the aspects that are related to programming, such as learning different programming languages. Another aspect which I want to learn is the SQL language. Other than just theory, I really value practical knowledge too, I do agree that having high knowledge in the theoretical side, does help a lot, but at the same time if you do not have the practical knowledge to execute the theoretical knowledge, it may not help you. I also am looking really forward to learn new things about the security of a device, and how those specific anti-virus programs are made that protect the data of the device.</p>

								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
![https://github.com/MeetThakker/MeetThakker.github.io/wiki/_new](         MeetThakker.github.io/images/FJ.PNG       ) <span class="image featured"><img src= "MeetThakker.github.io/images/FJ.PNG" alt="" /></span>

<p>As we can see that the job requires a minimum of three years of experience to attain the job. The company are looking for someone, that provides great advice on IT security, has the ability to take out some research, and to also then have the ability to improve/develop the Security Framework. What really makes this position appealing to me, is the amount of pay the company is ready to give, at only an earlier stage of the employee’s career, another aspect which I really think makes this job extremely attractive is the amount of teamwork that is required, and the collaboration you get to do with external partners. Working together makes everything much easier at time, as you’re not the only one that must take the burden of completing a task or a project by yourself.</p>
<p>The skills that are required for the position is obviously needing the right communication skills, having the right knowledge in executing plans such as taking out technical assessments, providing support for the various tests that are taken out, and also managing the implementation of security upgrades, which means staying active and staying on top of your game.</p>
<p>The skills that I currently have is be communicative, I strongly feel that communicating with clients, other workers or the management will not be a barrier for myself, but other than that I do not have the ‘qualified skills’ of the position, such as having knowledge in the security field. I also do not have the amount of experience that is required in that particular sector.</p>
<p>I will try my best to learn as much as possible in the security field of IT, gain experience by hopefully getting work experience at other companies, if a company wants me to gain experience by just doing volunteer work, It would still be a great achievement for me at the start of my career, as I am getting the opportunity to gain valuable experience. Which means that I will have to gain some experience in the security field, before making my next move by going into the workforce, to find a job that meets my qualifications.</p>

								<h3>Project Idea</h3>
								<p>Overview: My project idea is about, making a driverless car, which does not require humans to drive it, or to even be in it while it is carrying out its process. The driverless car should be so advanced that when it drops one person off, it should be able to go back home on its own and give a lift to another person from the family. For example, if my dad wants to work at 9:00 in the morning, and my mother wants to go shopping at 12:00, the car should have the ability to go back home, and to drop my mother off at the shops at 12 o’clock. I also want the car to be functioned by harmless resources, such as the utilization of Solar Panels.</p>
								<p>Motivation: It has been proven that because of high traffic levels productivity has been decreased, between businesses, because of the suppliers being late due to traffic, it causes the supplies to be late, which causes problems in the manufacturing process, as the manufacturing cannot start without supplies. It has also been scientifically proven that, traffic causes more pollution and fuel consumption, as the vehicles on the road are still on, which causes the wastage of fuel and an increase in carbon emissions, which leads to an increase in pollution, which leads to many dangerous consequences that negatively affect our planet. Another main reason to which traffic is harmful, is because of the amount of people that reach late to their destined locations, such as work, university or schools.</p>
					<p>Description: This project is a car that will have the most advanced features that most other companies will start to take the idea into account. Such as having an inbuilt navigation system that is connected to its sensors and cameras. Which means that whenever a pedestrian comes In front of the car, the navigation system should automatically grab its information from its cameras and sensors and it should be able to stop itself from the pedestrian, the cameras and the sensors should have at least 500m/1km of range, so that it is easily able to recognise a moving object, rather than it realising it late, which would make it really late for the car to put the brakes on, which may lead to trouble for the pedestrian and the passenger. Another feature it should have is the ability of the car to take the passenger to their destined locations and returning home or picking up the next person from their location and giving them a lift back to where ever they would like to go. Another feature that the car has, that it is run on solar power and another backup feature that the car has is that it has a backup plan of fuel, so if someday the car has a functional or a technical problem, with its solar, the car can run on fuel, this would have a program telling the car that It has problems with the solar powered system, so it should switch by itself and use the fuel. The program will still notify the passenger the problem that it has, and it should also display some troubleshooting methods. The smart navigation system will also be attached to the driving system itself, which means that if there is some sort of traffic on your way to the location, it will be able to pick easiest and the fastest way to get to the location that the passenger wants to go to. This also means sometimes the navigation system may pick up gravel roads, or those sorts of roads that the passenger may feel uncomfortable in, therefore the passenger will be given an option, to take the fastest route, before the navigation system executes its trip. Since some passengers, especially if we take the aging passengers into account, some of them do not like high speeds, and it may cause them problems, if the car is going at a high speed and they do not know how to lower the speed or pull over the car, and therefore there will be a feature that will have the ability to adjust the speed according to the speed limit, which means that there will be a manual operations speed adjuster that will be presented in the car, so the aging passengers, for example in a 100km/h speed limit zone, the passengers have the ability to lower the speed down to 70km/h, as the navigation system picks up the fact that you are on the freeway, and the speed limit according to the current situations is 100km/h, but for example when there is a condition such as roadworks, the navigation system should pick that up, and tell the speed limit program to lower down the speeds. Occasionally if the navigation system has not been updated by the server, and it does not know that there is a roadwork condition ahead, the passenger should be able to tell/manually change the speed limit, by going through a simple program ‘Speed Limit-Roadwork’, or the user is not well informed about how to process the program, there will be a 40km/h emergency button, which the passenger can use to lower its speed.</p>
					<p>Tools and Technologies: The type of software that is required is obviously needed to be very well designed and it also must have a lot of backup plans. The whole navigation system that has the cameras and the sensors connected to it, they especially must be programmed very well, and should have the ability to solve minor problems on its own, rather than troubling the passenger. The type of hardware that should be used is obviously the navigation antennas that helps the system to get signals from the GPS satellite. Another form of hardware is the cameras that will be surrounded around the car, and also the sensors that will also be surrounded around the cars. The type of software that will be used, really matters, as there should be GPS program, alongside with software that can handle and deals with cameras and sensors.</p>		</div>
					<p>Skills required: The software that will be utilized needs to be a combination of the utilization of GPS software and software that connects, the cameras the sensors of the car to the navigational system. As said before cameras and sensors will be required, there obviously needs to be a well designed body of that car, that has the ability to place the cameras and sensors in the right places. It may be a little hard to attain the type of software that is required, but other than that the hardware, will not be as hard to achieve, as that has already been implemented on the cars that are on the roads these days.</p>
					<p>Outcome: If this project is successful, there will be a huge increase in productivity, this is simply because of the amount of reduction in traffic. Because there will be less cars on the road, due to the fact that families will be requiring less amount of cars, because it is able to drop them off and pick them up individually, it means that families would not buy more cars, as it is not necessary, this means that suppliers are able to get in their supplies much more quicker, which increases productivity for businesses. It also means that individuals such as students, workers and people that need to get to a specific location, can reach their much quicker than before. Another huge factor that has be massive consideration factor is the amount of pollution that will be decreased after the utilization off solar powered technology. Because of using renewable energy, it means that there will be less pollution created on the planet. Which means that many problems that were previously created because of pollution, such as global warming or dirty air, will be helped to be reduce than before. It also means that because fuel is such an inelastic product, and it has a huge role in our proportion of income, it means that because of renewable energy, that amount of income that you save, can be used in a much-desired place in which you want to spend that money in.</p>
