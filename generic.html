						<h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
						<p>My interest in IT, is in various sectors, such as cyber security, Web Developing and being an IT consultant, and there will be many more areas which will interest me when, In the progress of my degree. My interest In IT developed as a child, it all started from the time, to which both my parents bought a smartphone for themselves, and I would always as a child play new games and try out all the new features possible. My father is a Mechanical Engineer, so he would always be working on machines, which he would tell me about, and he would also tell me all sorts of things about computers, which led a spark in me to study IT. One of my IT experiences was that, in year 9, when I was a high school student, suddenly, one day my laptop did not turn on, and I did watch some YouTube videos to help me solve the problem, since it was a hardware problem on the motherboard I did need some help, so my dad and myself worked on it to figure what the problem was, and we eventually fixed it. 
						
						I chose RMIT university, because I believe that it has a huge reputation in the sector of Technology and Engineering. I also chose RMIT, because I have had a lot of friends recommend it to me and I also have a few senior friends who also currently attend RMIT university.
						
						I expect to learn also sorts of things during this course, especially the aspects that are related to programming, such as learning different programming languages. Another aspect which I want to learn is the SQL language. Other than just theory, I really value practical knowledge too, I do agree that having high knowledge in the theoretical side, does help a lot, but at the same time if you do not have the practical knowledge to execute the theoretical knowledge, it may not help you. I also am looking really forward to learn new things about the security of a device, and how those specific anti-virus programs are made that protect the data of the device. </p>

								<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
![https://github.com/MeetThakker/MeetThakker.github.io/wiki/_new](         MeetThakker.github.io/images/FJ.PNG       ) <span class="image featured"><img src= "MeetThakker.github.io/images/FJ.PNG" alt="" /></span>

								<p>As we can see that the job requires a minimum of three years of experience to attain the job. The company are looking for someone, that provides great advice on IT security, has the ability to take out some research, and to also then have the ability to improve/develop the Security Framework. What really makes this position appealing to me, is the amount of pay the company is ready to give, at only an earlier stage of the employee’s career, another aspect which I really think makes this job extremely attractive is the amount of teamwork that is required, and the collaboration you get to do with external partners. Working together makes everything much easier at time, as you’re not the only one that must take the burden of completing a task or a project by yourself. 
	The skills that are required for the position is obviously  the right communication skills, having the right knowledge in executing plans such as taking out technical assessments, providing support for the various tests that are taken out, and also managing the implementation of security upgrades, which means staying active and staying on top of your game.
	The skills that I currently have is be communicative, I strongly feel that communicating with clients, other workers or the management will not be a barrier for myself, but other than that I do not have the ‘qualified skills’ of the position, such as having knowledge in the security field. I also do not have the amount of experience that is required in that particular sector. 
	I will try my best to learn as much as possible in the security field of IT, gain experience by hopefully getting work experience at other companies, if a company wants me to gain experience by just doing volunteer work, It would still be a great achievement for me at the start of my career, as I am getting the opportunity to gain valuable experience. Which means that I will have to gain some experience in the security field, before making my next move by going into the workforce, to find a job that meets my qualifications.</p>
