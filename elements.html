								<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>						
								<p>These tests for me mean that, I have the chance to really know myself better, which means that now I will also have the chance to really, take up that responsibility to improve on aspects that I would really need in the future.</p>
					
			<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
								<p>I will not be influenced by these results at all, as they do not really bother me in a team. This is because I will be totally focussed on what the team requires, this also means that I will also rather be focused on how my suggestions affect the project, and how I can contribute to my upmost potential, to help the team. Thereby these tests would not have effects on my behaviour, as these things do not really matter to me.</p>
			<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
								<p>If I do take my test results into consideration, the very first shows me that I am a debater, which may mean that I may choose partners, that are more quite (In the form of talking), and stick to them, as they would not really like to argue, and just get the work done to its best. My second test presents, that I am a visual and a listening learner, which means that when I choose my partners, I donâ€™t want them to only focus on working by themselves and only putting in just a bit of communication work, but rather I want my partners to be as keen as me, and hopefully they would also learn the same way as I do. My third test shows that I also like to be imaginative, which means that I do not only want partners that are narrow minded, but rather people who love to brainstorm new things, and helping the group to develop new ideas.</p>
