								<h3>Basic Background Information</h3>
								<p>I am currently a student at RMIT university, studying Information Technology. My nationality/background is Indian, I came to Australia when I was five years old (2006), my father came a year earlier to find a job that met his qualifications, and when he did find a good job, he decided to call my mother and myself over, I also have a little brother who was born in Australia. I can speak up to three languages (English, Gujarati and Hindi). A fact about me is that I love cricket, and all other sports, but the main reason to which cricket is my favourite sport, is because of the situations that the game can lead up to, such as situations to which there is a lot of pressure, and it teaches you the mindset you should have when you’re going through those circumstances (such as staying calm and not giving your wicket away). </p>
